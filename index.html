        - <span class="bold">How the Web Works:</span> The web is a bunch of computers that communicate with each other.  
        When a person goes to a web page like <a href="https://www.google.com">www.google.com</a>, their computer sends a HTTP 
        Request to a server. The server finds the appropriate HTML document and sends it back to the user's computer
        where a web browser interprets the page and displays it on the user's screen
        <br>- <span class="bold">HTML:</span>  HTML stands for <span class="italic">Hypertext Markup Language</span>. HTML documents form the majority of the content on 
        the web. HTML documents contain text content which describes "what you see" and markup which describes "how it looks"
        <br>-<span class="bold">Tags and Elements:</span>  HTML documents are made of HTML elements. When writing HTML, we tell browsers the type 
        of each element by using HTML tags
        <br>-<span class="bold">Why Computers are Stupid:</span>  Computers are stupid because they interpret instructions literally. This makes 
        them very unforgiving since a small mistake by a programmer can cause huge problems in a program. 
        <br>-<span class="bold">Inline vs Block Elements:</span>  HTML elements are either inline or block. Block elements form an "invisible box"
        around the content inside of them

          The "tree-like structure" of HTML
        </div>
        <div class="concept-description">
          <p>
            The "tree-like structure" comes from the fact that HTML
            elements can have other elements inside of them. You can
            draw this relationship like a family tree. My mother
            had multiple children. So did her mother, and so on...
          </p>
          <p>
            In a browser, this structure shows up as a series
            of nested boxes. There are boxes inside of boxes
            inside of boxes, and so on...

        </div>
        <div class="concept-description">
          <p>
            When you read an HTML document as
            <em>text</em>, you see a wave of
            changing indentations going up and down the left side
            of the document. The more indented an element is, the
            more deeply nested its corresponding "box" is.
          </p>
          <p>
            	HTML and CSS are both "languages".
            HTML controls the "structure" of a web page.
	            CSS controls the "style" of a page (how it looks).
	            When programmers talk about the "DOM" (Document Object Model) they are talking about the tree-like structure of a page.

          <p> 
            Lesson gave example of moving boxes.  Boxes can have several labels and the same applies to HTML tags, they can belong to multiple classes.  You may want to say items that go to the Kitchen are also fragile so you may add, Handle with Care.

          Avoiding Repetition
        </div>
        <div class="concept-description">
          <p>
            Avoiding repetition is important for a variety of reasons.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Avoiding Errors:</b> When programmers <em>don't</em> avoid repetition, they will often have to do the same thing over and over. This may mean copy and pasting certain style attributes into many HTML elements or rewriting the same code (sometimes with minor differences) many times. This can lead to errors when the programmer decides to make a change to something. If they don't dilligently make that same change everywhere the repeated code appears, problems will arise.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Consistency:</b> In this web page, I wanted every lesson to look the same. Instead of manually giving each one the same style, I was able to assign each lesson <span class="bold">div</span> the same <span class="bold">class</span> and then specify the style for that class in only one place! By avoiding repetion, it's now very easy for me to make changes to this style.

        <div class="concept-description">
          <p>
            CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets and they give programmers a way to control the style of related HTML elements. This is done by giving similar HTML elements the same <span class="bold">class</span> name and then specifying the style that should apply to that class.

          Box Sizing and Positioning
        </div>
          <p>
            <b>Box Sizing</b> -
              There are four main points that Jessica addressed about box sizing.  HTML elements are boxes and each box has 4 components.
	              Because there are so many components to each box, it can often be hard to get the size.
		              Set sizes in terms of percents rather than pixels.
		              Set the box-sizing attribute to border-box for every element. 
	              Different browsers work slightly differently. Sometimes this causes different browsers to display the same code  differently.
                <br>
            <b>Box Positioning </b> - Divs are block elements (as opposed to inline), so by default they take up the entire width of a page.
	              Adding the rule display: flex; to the appropriate CSS will override this behavior and let divs appear next to each other.
